Objectives
===
The course gives basic knowledge in object­oriented analysis and design, the basics of 
the modeling language UML and the implementation of analysis and design models using
an object­oriented programming language.

After completing the course the student is expected to:

- Understand the concepts and principles of object­oriented analysis and design
- Be able to develop object­oriented models in UML for different problems
- Be able to transform object­oriented models into an object­oriented programming language and vice versa
- Have basic knowledge of the use of design patterns
- Have basic knowledge of refactoring as a design method.

Content
===
The theory provides the fundamental principles, which are used as the basis for the 
creation of self­knowledge, which is then used in practical applications.

Course elements:

- Principles and methods for object­oriented analysis and domain modeling in UML
- Principles and methods for object­oriented design in UML
- Principles and methods of use of design patterns
- Transformation of object­oriented design to object­oriented implementation and vice versa
- Principles and methods for refactoring of object­oriented implementation method of object­oriented design
