## Requirements

### Functional requirements PWD:
* The application should be a single page application.
* The user shall be able to open multiple windows within the application.
* The user shall be able to drag and move the windows in the document.
* The user shall be able to open and close new windows of the desired application by clicking or double clicking an icon at the desktop.
* The icon used to open the window should be represented in the upper bar of the window.
* Windows should get focus when clicked/dragged.
* The window with focus shall be on top of all other windows.

The following three applications should at least be included in the desktop application:
* A memory-game
* A chat connected to a central chat channel using websockets
* One, by you, designed and decided application

### Non functional requirements PWD:
* The application shall be visually appealing
* The code shall be organized in appropriate modules

## The memory game application

### Functional requirements, Memory application:
* The user should be able to open and play multiple memory games simultaneously.
* The user should be able to play the game using only the keyboard.
* One, by you decided, extended feature

## The chat application
The chat application shall be connected to other students chats via a web socket-server.

### The server

You connect to the server via web sockets and send messages using the json format:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "data" : "The message text is sent using the data property",
  "username": "MyFancyUsername",
  "channel": "my, not so secret, channel",
  "key": "A api-key. Found when logged in on the course webpage"
}
```
The properties `type`, `data`, `username` and `key` are mandatory when **sending** a message to the server.
The properties `type`, `data` and  `username` will always be present when you **receive** a message from the server. Additionally, all properties sent from one user will be echoed to all receiving clients.

### Heartbeat
The web socket server will send a "heartbeat" message to keep the connection open. This message is sent every 40 seconds and have the following structure:
```json
{
  "type": "heartbeat",
  "data" : "",
  "username": "Server"
}
```

Your application can simply ignore those messages completly.

### Functional requirements, Chat application:
* The user should be able to have several chat applications running at the same time.
* When the user opens the application for the first time the user should be asked to write his/her username.
* The username should remain the same the next time the user starts a chat application or the PWD is restarted.
* The user should be able to send chat messages using a textarea.
* The user should be able to see at least the 20 latest messages since the chat applications was opened.
* One, by you decided, extended feature.

You are free to add functionality not described above. Added functionality could be:
* Ability to choose which channel to listen to.
* Caching message history.
* Added support for emojis.
* Added support for writing code.
* Ability to change username.
* Encrypted messages on a special channel to allow secret communication.
* Added functionality to the "chat protocol". Discuss with others in the course and agree upon added functionality to add to the sent messages.
* Use the messages to play memory against an opponent. Perferably using a seperate channel.
